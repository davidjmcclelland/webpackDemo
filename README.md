# webpackDemo
corresponds to this lesson:
https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

* This is a "before" example showing a project that is not managed by webpack.
* It contains a dependency on lodash library, but the dependency is only found in Javascript
if you know where to look in the js file. 
* The lodash library is imported in the index.html.
* this is probably fine if you are doing a static site with a few dependencies that will be distributed with your site.
