# webpackDemo 3-configuration
corresponds to this lesson:
https://webpack.js.org/guides/getting-started/

* This is the "after" example showing a project that is managed by webpack.
* We added a configuration file and added the npx webpack command to the 
package.json scripts so it can be run by entering:

          `npm run build`
   which also runs any other scripts in the order they are entered there by a common pm command.
